These are my answers to the 2015 advent of code which I did in school and when I didnt think to save part 1 to days I tried part 2 in unfortunatly. 
Looking back, some of these solutions are not very good and can definitely be optimised but I didn't know when I made them. 
I got 39 stars in total by missing: D12 pt2, D13, D19 pt2, D20, D22 and D24. 
My favourite was definitly D18 as that required you to make the game of life which was really interesting and I even made a better visualisation of the game of life that goes on forever using colours and has a delay between stages.
Another one of my favourites was D7 which involved doing binary arithmatic on a very large ammount of variables which felt really good to solve though, it looks really messy and I could definitely improve using different classes
